	<p>The arena is a game where you create a gladiator, customizable with a selection of stats and skills, 
		gear up by spending your gold in the marketplace on weapons and armour, fight other players in the arena
		 or train against the beasts. <br>Compete in tournaments against other players and go on quests in the dark forest to try to get unique items and great riches!
		<br><br>
		To the right is a screenshot of a character sheet showing all the stats and skills available.
		<br>
		There is also a screenshot of what combat looks like!<br>
		Currently you can fight 1v1,2v2 or 3v3.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Your character cannot die, but he can become mortally wounded and unable to perform any action in some time. You can chose to pay gold to get express healing and quickly become fully restored.
		</p>
		<p>The game is played in seasons with each season lasting about a month. At the end of the season the top 32 gladiators face eachother in a tournament to the death where there will only be one winner!</br>
