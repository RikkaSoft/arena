            	<li>Dryads can no longer regenerate more than their health when starting a match</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Training</h4>
            <ul>
            	<li>The training has been completely reworked, it is now fought in zones instead of directly versus one creature, fight up to ten rounds in a zone and get a chain bonus in XP and Gold if you can beat your opponents</li>
            	<li>Training uses the same combat engine as Arena so enemies can now have the same kind of gear and can do criticals, foul plays etc.</li>
            	<li>Training areas has hidden bosses which can drop special rewards</li>
            </ul>
